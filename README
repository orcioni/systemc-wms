This library requires SystemC version 2.1 or higher, gcc version 3.3 or higher, and math lib lapack3.
To compile, make sure Makefile-local contains reasonable values for your system and then run make in this directory.
To use gcc 4.x with SystemC 2.1 patch SystemC file sc_module.h.
SystemC 2.2 is fully compatible with gcc 4.x
To compile an example, cd to the "example" directory and run make there.

New directory "include/devices" added.
All user modules are stored in "devices" directory.
These modules are either typedef of template modules either new modules written from scratch.
New user modules can be added in "devices" directory or in the user project directory.

In "include/sys" are stored the template modules that are used as typedef in "devices" directory.
In "include/nature" there are the definition of used nature: hydraulic, mechanical, threephase, electrical, acoustical, rotational.
