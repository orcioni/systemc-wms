2008       ChangeLog updating discontinued
16.07.2007 Giorgio Biagetti
	   added "decibel" class to aid expression of logarithmic values.
	   Version updated to match paper published on EURASIP Journal on Embedded Systems.
06.10.2007 Giorgio Biagetti
	   added "oversample" parameter to sine generator to override time step (previous default oversample factor was 100*pi, current default is 256).
	   added "composite_signal" class to allow the combination of different generator sources by means of the "+" operator.
	   added experimental and non-working file-reader signal generator.
27.09.2007 Giorgio Biagetti
	   added experimental subsampling capability to tab_trace.
27.07.2007 Simone Orcioni
           added LsCp_Ladder, second order low pass filter, two port 
	   with L series and C parallel
11.06.2007 Giorgio Biagetti
	   fixed operator precedence bug in the state initialization routine.
16.04.2007 Simone Orcioni
           chosen as default the Adams-Moulton ode solver. performs better, but            it is a little slower. To change it, edit analog_system.cpp
           changed adaptive time step algorithm
21.03.2007 Simone Orcioni
	   added istant probe module, iprobe. removed in modules a parameter to            choose the rate in adaptive time step.
14.03.2007 Simone Orcioni
	   modified module probe in probes library, now it uses as state variable the charge instead of voltage.
15.02.2007 Simone Orcioni
           corrected bug in nonlinear library, controlled_switch modules
05.02.2007 Simone Orcioni
           corrected Makefile in example directory
30.12.2006 Giorgio Biagetti
	added support for direct/reverse connection of ports to channel
	"slots" by means of unary operators "+" and "-" applied to channels.
16.12.2006 Giorgio Biagetti
	added support for wavechannels with arbitrary connection topologies and named binding of ports to channel's "slots" for anisotropic topologies.
01.11.2006 Simone Orcioni
        added file with some constant values
20.10.2006 Giorgio Biagetti, Simone Orcioni
	added support for gcc compiler versions higher than 3.3
19.09.2006 Giorgio Biagetti, Simone Orcioni
	added TCTS component in "ideal", the controlled_switch component in "nonlinear" and the controlled switch with recycling diode moved from HB.cpp to "nature/electrical".
	added some comments and new components in "nature/electrical"
	added "nature/hydraulic"
	corrected some wrong time constants in "sys/oneport" and "sys/twoport" and move some component from one to the other
        loss in "wave_system" brought back to its original value of 0.1
04.07.2006 Giorgio Biagetti, Simone Orcioni
	* LICENCE SystemC-WMS released under the GNU General Public License
	terms.
	* ChangeLog writing started
	SystemC-WMS version 0.6 has been released.
22.06.2006 Giorgio Biagetti, Simone Orcioni
	SystemC-WMS version 0.5 has been released.
	This version contains substantial improvements to the component library as well as to the overall project organization. Users accustomed to the previous
version are invited to have a look at the "include" directory to discover the new header file layout.
